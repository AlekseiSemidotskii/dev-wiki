# Time management

Areas for balancing:
- Job
- Life
- Personal development

## Day planning

There will never be enough time to get everything done.
But there will always be enough time to get the most important things done.

The process is:
* List all tasks for the day
* Estimate task time and sequence by Priority/Importance
* Delegate some tasks

Priorities
* Pareto rule - 80% of tasks / 20% efforts
* Eisenhower matrix
* Common sense
* Don't mix up priorities and enthusiasm!

Effectiveness
* Achiving result
* Using the shortest way
* During the minimal possible time

### Eisenhower matrix

Decide: Do you have to do it yourself? If not - delegate!

If the price of your time is higher than the price of service - buy the service and "free your time".

Divide "what to do" and "when to do":
* Stiff tasks - connected to definite time
* Flexible tasks - can be done at any time
* Budgeted tasks - big tasks which need a long period of time to do
