# The Web As an Application Platform

The key points of Web success:

* Technology Support
* Scalability and Performance
* Loose Coupling
* Business Processes
* Consistency and Uniformity
* Simplicity, Architectural Pervasiveness, and Reach
* Web Friendliness and the Richardson Maturity Model

> As developers ourselves, we understand how we can believe that asynchronous message-centric solutions are the most scalable and highest-performing options.
However, existing high-performance and highly available services on the Web are proof that a synchronous, text-based request-response protocol can provide good performance and massive scalability when used correctly.

## Standards

* HTTP Status Codes [RFC7231 HTTP/1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231) and [RFC7540 HTTP/2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540).
* Error responses [RFC 7807: Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807)
