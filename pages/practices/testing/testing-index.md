**What should I test in my application? How many tests should I have?**

The answer varies across use-cases, but as a rule of thumb, you can follow the guidelines set by the **test pyramid**.

The test pyramid describes that you should write unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests as well. 

You should have more integration tests than end-to-end tests, and even more unit tests.
