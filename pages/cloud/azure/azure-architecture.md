## What is a region?

A region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.

A few examples of regions are _West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West_.

## Special Azure regions

Azure has specialized regions that you might want to use when building out your applications for compliance or legal purposes. These include:

* US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for US government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened US persons and include additional compliance certifications.

* China East, China North and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft does not directly maintain the datacenters.

Regions are what you use to identify the location for your resources, but there are two other terms you should also be aware of: _geographies and availability zones_.

## Geographies

Azure divides the world into geographies that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders.

Geographies are broken up into the following areas:

* Americas
* Europe
* Asia Pacific
* Middle East and Africa
