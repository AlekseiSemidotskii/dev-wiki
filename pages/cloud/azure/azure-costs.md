# Azure Costs

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator

[Calculate](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/)

Working with the TCO Calculator involves three steps:

* Define your workloads.
* Adjust assumptions.
* View the report.

First, you enter the specifications of your on-premises infrastructure into the TCO Calculator, based on these four categories:

**Servers**

This category includes operating systems, virtualization methods, CPU cores, and memory (RAM).

**Databases**

This category includes database types, server hardware, and the Azure service you want to use, which includes the expected maximum concurrent user sign-ins.

**Storage**

This category includes storage type and capacity, which includes any backup or archive storage.

**Networking**

This category includes the amount of network bandwidth you currently consume in your on-premises environment.

Does location or network traffic affect cost?

Different regions can have different associated prices. Because geographic regions can impact where your network traffic flows, network traffic is a cost influence to consider as well.

Zones for billing of network traffic

A zone is a geographical grouping of Azure regions for billing purposes. The following zones include some of the regions as shown here:
* Zone 1: Australia Central, West US, East US, Canada West, West Europe, France Central, and others
* Zone 2: Australia East, Japan West, Central India, Korea South, and others
* Zone 3: Brazil South, South Africa North, South Africa West, UAE Central, UAE North
DE Zone 1: Germany Central, Germany Northeast

## Estimate workload cost by using the Pricing calculator

[Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

* Define your requirements first

Manage and minimize total cost on Azure:
* Understand estimated costs before you deploy
* Use Azure Advisor to monitor your usage
* Use spending limits to restrict your spending
* Use Azure Reservations to prepay
    - Azure Reservations can save you up to 72 percent as compared to pay-as-you-go prices. To receive a discount, you reserve services and resources by paying in advance
* Choose low-cost locations and regions
* Research available cost-saving offers
* Use Azure Cost Management + Billing to control spending
* Apply tags to identify cost owners
* Resize underutilized virtual machines
* Deallocate virtual machines during off hours
* Delete unused resources
* Migrate from IaaS to PaaS services
* Save on licensing costs
    - Choose cost-effective operating systems
* Use Azure Hybrid Benefit to repurpose software licenses on Azure. Available if your licenses are covered by _Software Assurance_
